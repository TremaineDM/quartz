## The World

### Guilds

#### Researcher’s guild

Enraptured by the secrets of the abyss. The researcher's guild’s goal is to learn how the abyss functions, learn its curse, geography, wildlife and artifacts. Often wizards and artificers, the researcher's guild houses powerful magic. The abyss is especially antagonistic towards this group as they attempt to uncover its secrets.

#### Delver’s guild

Explorers of the abyss, their goals are to map out the abyss, reach the bottom, gain fame and find artifacts. The delver's guild has the most diverse cast of members, each diving into the abyss for their own reasons. You’ll often find Delvers spread out around the abyss, they never stay in outposts too long and are most likely to be found in the deepest reaches of the abyss.

#### Development guild

Responsible for building outposts, roads and waypoints in the abyss. Their goal is the modernization of the abyss as they attempt to tame the wilds of the abyss. One of the most difficult jobs because the members need to stay in place for long periods of time while building/protecting their objectives. The development guild is very active towards the upper layers of the abyss and tapers out the lower they get. The members are very competent in battle, building and are always well stocked with supplies.
